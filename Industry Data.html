Overall the groups ideal jobs were very similar ranging from engineering to developer roles. They all consist of software engineering, teamwork, communications and problem-solving skills. 
The differentiating requirements were primarily the level of problem solving required which is the main difference between the engineering roles and the developer roles in the first place. 
Matthew's and Rob's software developer jobs were very similar being both front-end and back-end developer roles, however Tabitha's and Gavin's engineering jobs were not so similar. 
While both engineering job descriptions described high levels of problem solving, Tabitha's data engineer role focusses primarily on databases while Gavin's network engineer role focusses 
on networks either through hardware or software.<br><br>

All of our ideal jobs ranked very highly in the Burning Glass 'Top IT Job Titles' list. This was greatly reassuring not only because the increasing demand means increasing salaries but 
also increasing career longevity. Putting in years of hard work feels totally justified by the thought of joining a thriving industry with our own personal skillsets and knowing that our 
unique skillsets will be highly sort after re-emphasizes our motivation to succeed. While our ideal jobs were slightly although understandably different from the normal job titles, they 
can easily be organised under professions after reviewing the job descriptions.<br><br>
  
Rob's mobile application developer position could be placed in any of the software developer job titles. The highest role on the list that fits the mould is the front-end developer title, 
sitting 6th on the list. The required skillset for the role includes documentation skills, web security understanding, experience testing and resolving security concerns, team work skills, 
PHP, Java, React Native, Git, SQL, iOS & Android skills. The advertised job also required Babel, webpack, Gulp, NPM, Karma and Grant experience.

<i>"A front-end web developer is responsible for implementing visual elements that users see and interact with in a web application. They are usually supported by back-end web developers, who 
are responsible for server-side application logic and integration of the work front-end developers do." - <a href="https://www.toptal.com/front-end/job-description">toptal.com</a></i><br><br>

Gavin's network engineer role sits 9th on the list. The required skillset for the role includes analytical and security management skills, team work skills, Cisco, VMware NSX, Azure and 
Amazon Web Services experience. The advertised job also required security systems skills and firewall management skills.

<i>"Network engineers design and implement network configurations, troubleshoot performance issues, carry out network monitoring and configure security systems such as firewalls." - 
<a href="https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/network-engineer">searchnetworking.techtarget.com</a></i><br><br>

Tabitha's data engineer position fits the information engineer mould and can also be classified as a software engineer since a data engineer is merely a software engineering approach to 
designing and developing information systems. A software engineer sits at 11th on the list. The required skillset for the role includes Python, SQL, NoSQL and Azure experience. The advertised 
job also required problem solving skills, communications skills, team work skills, project management skills, business analysis experience and an understanding of building relationships with 
stakeholders.

<i>"A data engineer is someone who develops, constructs, tests and maintains architectures, such as databases and large-scale processing systems." - 
<a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/data-scientist-vs-data-engineer">datacamp.com</a></i><br><br>

Matthew's ideal position of an "Internet of Things" full stack (front-end + back-end) developer can be classified into a number of software engineering roles however the highest role in demand 
that the role fits into is a front-end developer, which sits at 6th on the list. The required skillset for the role includes .net, NoSQL, AWS, NodeJS, TypeScript and Node.js experience. The 
advertised job also required software engineering skills, documentation skills, project management experience, communications skills, problem solving and teamwork experience.

<i>"A full stack developer is someone who can work on both the front-end and back-end portions of an application." - 
<a href="https://www.zeebiz.com/india/news-20-higher-demand-for-full-stack-developers-this-year-report-68106">www.zeebiz.com</a></i><br><br>

While some of our groups job titles may sit higher or lower on the list, the list itself reflects the total outrageously increasing demand by the growing industry across the whole IT spectrum. 
It is expected that the highest-ranking roles would be starting or entry level roles so the fact that all of the groups ideal jobs are high on this list accentuates that all the roles are in 
very high demand. Furthermore, Information Technology is an ever-expanding industry and one of the fastest growing industries worldwide and any of the jobs on the Burning Glass list of most 
desired roles would be a great choice to forge a path into let alone the highly desirable roles our group has chosen to aim for.<br><br>

	
After analysing the Burning Glass IT Skills data and the General Skills data our group was able to compare and differentiate a large combination of required skills relating to our ideal jobs. 
The necessary IT-specific skills common to the group were Project management, SQL, software engineering, systems engineering, Git, Python, Azure, Microsoft Windows, Java, JavaScript, business 
analysis, C#, Amazon Web Services (Cloud Computing). Of the top 15 IT-specific skills in demand by employers, 8 are in our groups required skill list. The other 4 IT-specific skills are lower 
down the list which still highlights that they are in demand. The necessary general skills common to the group were Problem solving, communication skills, planning, writing, team work, 
troubleshooting/debugging, detail orientated, leadership, organisational skills, analytical skills, time management, decision making, creativity. Of the top 15 general skills in demand by 
employers, only 4 are not in our groups required skill list. This highlights the healthy base covering of general skills that our groups ideal jobs require.<br><br>

	
While comparing and differentiating all the skills in demand by the IT Industry our group was able to determine a small number of IT-specific and general skills not required by any of our group 
members. The three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in our required skill set are SAP experience , graphic design skills and business management skills. The three highest ranked 
general skills which are not in our required skill set are research skills, mentoring experience and quality assurance and control skills. While these skills are not necessary for being selected 
or accepted for our ideal roles they are still highly valued skills and would definitely be of value to us.<br><br>


Having looked at the Burning Glass data, the group was then asked to decide if our ideal jobs had changed and explain why or why not.<br><br>


Rob - Front End Developer:<br>
"After viewing the Burning Glass data, I have not changed my mind about my ideal role in the IT industry. I'm happy with my personal goal of obtaining a front-end developer role and the thought 
that there are other IT roles in more demand does not bother me at all as the only role I truly want is to create and program apps, websites, games etc. I am interested in the creative side of IT 
and am quite aware that if you do what you love you will find a way to make it work successfully."<br><br>


Gavin - Network Engineer:<br>
"After Assignment 1, and using GitHub/HTML for producing a web page, I really enjoyed the production of the page. I still really like the idea of Network Engineer as a career as choice as I am 
quite particular with my tasks, aiming for perfection in execution and maintenance. However the creativity side of Web Design really interested me as I find that I have a creative side which I don't 
use much and when I tap into it is quite satisfying, particularly when the end result is something I am please with."<br><br>
