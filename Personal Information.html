After joining together as a group, we decided that Group #11 was not going to be a sufficient enough name. After brainstorming 
for quite a while and not coming up with anything mature or professional, Tabitha came up with the simple yet genius idea of 
combining all our first name initials together to form an acronym. This created our new group name MR GT.

	<p style="font-size: 20px">
	My general interests consist of surfing, music, guitar, computers, gaming, golf, soccer, rugby and other team sports. 
From the moment my family bought our first Macintosh computer in the early 1990's, I was hooked on computers from enjoying using 
the software to building Pentium PC's. When I got my Sony PlayStation 1, I fell instantly in love with computer and console games. 
Years later and numerous computers, consoles and portable devices later I still have the same passion to buy, build, play, pull 
apart and fix such devices.<br><br>

Later in my high school years I found another interest linking all of these different peripherals 
together: programming. After learning Realbasic in high school and later learning C++ and Visualbasic at university I knew I would 
always keep these skills even just as a hobby. After a number of years pursuing other fields of study and work, I kept returning 
to my passion with building computers and pc/console gaming. These constant reminders assured me that I should turn this hobby 
into a career. I choose to study at RMIT as it had the perfect start date and flexible study timetable to suit my needs.<br><br>

Currently I am working large hours in a small coastal town with the only business being a general store. The external online study of 2 
subjects starting every 13 weeks was perfect for my needs. I expect to learn how to program in a number of languages, using a 
number of programming tools, during the life of my course and continue to improve my ever-expanding problem-solving skills.<br>

	My interest in IT started quite young, tinkering with a Pentium 100 with 2 Mg Ram and 20 Mg HDD. I spent hours playing 
Wolfenstein 3D with no sound card, drank lots of coffee and generally had an awesome time. In that era that was all DOS based, 
which was very interesting and basic. I then upgraded to a better PC, the specs I can't remember sorry but it ran Windows 95 and 
I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. At this time the internet was something you used with a 28800 modem; I can 
still remember the noise it made connecting. I then started building my own PC's, playing more advanced games and then cable 
internet was connected to the house. My first bill was $1000 for the month, my wife was NOT VERY HAPPY! Needless to say, the 
internet was monitored very closely from that point forward.<br><br>

I found that building and networking PC's the most interesting facet of IT. It was always a competition to have the best PC 
on the block! I ran a LAN club for a few years where I would get a group of about 15 guys come around and we would all plug 
in and play games, snags and sauce in bread at lunch time, and then back to it for another couple of hours.<br><br>

An interesting fact about me is that I am an avid drinker and collector of single malt scotch. 
At one point I had over 60+ bottles in my collection, and then one day I just got sick of dusting them and thought to myself, 
I'm spending all this money on something I really enjoy and I wasn't actually enjoying them, so it began! I tasted each and 
every one of them and my favourite ended up being a scotch from the Lark distillery in Tasmania of all places. It was amazing, 
it actually had caramel notes in the flavour and who doesn't like caramel!<br><br>

With regards as to why I chose RMIT as my university 
of choice, this is because of its worldwide ranking of being in the top 250 universities in the world. RMIT is globally 
recognized for its qualities and has a reputation for excellence in education. It is renowned for creating life changing 
experiences for its students and the leadership and support shown is second to none.<br>

	<p style="font-size: 20px">
	I'm of an Assyrian background but born in Australia, so I guess I'm Australian. Due to personal circumstances I have 
not been able to continue in long term studies since leaving high school in 2009. I did go to TAFE for a short period of time 
and I studied Laboratory Tech which was awesome. I can speak English and Assyrian. I'm into gaming mostly, or playing with my 
pets, currently have a cat named Lunar and my German Shepherd dog named Auditore (Audi for short). I named him after a game 
character, don't worry, I know it's sad now.<br><br>

I've always been interested in Information Technology, well mostly the hardware side of things, it started with building computers 
and putting the parts together. I also enjoyed looking into Virtual Machines and used to have a MAC on my Windows computer. 
I then started to get interested in hacking games, such as Hacknet, not like I was really hacking anything at the time but just 
the way technology is used in so many ways are interesting, it has so many capabilities and can be forged into anything the user 
wants.<br><br>

I didn't have a particular reason on why I chose RMIT, I wanted to actually do Information Technology & Data Analytics course 
initially but as I said previously, I have had depression for a couple of years now, so I haven't really been productive. I'm 
starting to get myself together and thought the best thing to do is start off slowly with two subjects on OUA. I kind of regret 
not going on campus, the structure would've helped a lot but now I am here and want to make this work.<br><br>

I'm already learning a lot, I used to look at GitHub and think "Wow! this looks complicated" but I seem to have it kind of worked 
out for now. I expect to learn a lot when it comes to computing languages and skills that I can use later in further subjects. I 
know that after these two subjects I will be hopefully looking to go on campus. If not, I will continue another two until I get 
into the data analytics course.<br>

The ability for IT solutions to provide precise control for computerised systems is what interests me. Most of my IT Experience 
has been through work, as well though reading and experimenting in my own time. At this point I have no commercial experience in 
coding or building software. I chose RMIT because I was looking for an online degree to provide flexibility around my work, and 
RMIT partners with OUA. Also, the industry connections and practical work appealed to me, because their courses don't just teach 
theory.<br><br>

From my studies I expect to learn coding fundamentals and concepts, to be able to build software to solve problems and provide 
business services. I also expect to learn the abilities for and practice at working in teams, including communication, collaboration, 
and using various online tools suitable for teams.<br>
