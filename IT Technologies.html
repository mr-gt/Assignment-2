    	<h3 style="font-size: 60px; color: orange">Autonomous Vehicles</h3> 
<p style="font-size: 20px;clear: both;">
<img src="Pics/self-driving-1.jpg" width="500" height="300" style="float:left;clear: both; margin-top:10px;margin-right:20px;border:10px solid orange;">
The idea of an autonomous vehicle has been around since the integration of 
cars and microchips. The dream of sitting in a seat similar to business class flights, watching movies, 
reading books and socialising with fellow passengers has been forever out of reach. However, in the 
coming decades, these days may soon be within our grasp. Only now are we adapting reliable and exciting 
new technologies to turn this dream into a reality. Most vehicles being released now feature some form 
of automation, even if it is still only the basic cruise control system. Some vehicles are even being 
released with newly developed autonomous technologies such as controlling small increments and decrements 
in cruising speeds during dense traffic, also known as adaptive cruise control, cars that can reverse 
parallel park without the driver's assistance and even include other features such as radar detection of 
cars in other lanes and safe overtaking systems for blind spots. In the upcoming years these automatic 
processes we currently have will be improved upon and will change or modify the necessary requirement of 
even being in control of the steering wheel at all. As of right now we have already developed autonomous 
vehicles that are completely driverless but are merely used as tour guides or used to provide elderly 
and/or disabled with new mobility services in places such as retirement villages. According to ADVI - 
the Australian and New Zealand Driverless Vehicle Initiative - we have attained partial automation, which 
in their 5 level system of automation, places our accomplishments at level 2. While we are close to achieving 
level 3 automation in the next few years, which includes all aspects of autonomous driving, the driver is 
still required to be ready at all times to take control of the wheel depending on certain situations. We are 
still approximately a decade from full automation and by 2026-2030, the goal of full automation may well be 
achieved. Full automation is detailed as not needing a driver at all and wont even require a steering wheel 
or a driver's seat in the vehicle anymore.<br>

Over the next decade or two, this autonomous technology will be enhanced even further to incorporate various 
other new technologies, some of which are still being developed theoretically and ethically. They have the 
potential to include new opportunities for various industries such as the energy sector, healthcare, financial 
and government services to include just a small few. From automatically paying tolls and fuel bills or fully 
automatic charging electric vehicles, collecting big data to improve cities drivability and driverless 
infrastructure, increasing energy efficiency to improving the safety of and even replacing the emergency services 
we currently rely on today, all these individual sectors or industries will be shaped by the autonomous potential 
lying ahead of us. There are a number of serious questions of ethical and social importance still yet to be 
explained and answered such as the effects on governments and energy sectors who have until now resisted new 
potential technological innovations and the ethical and societal questions relating to privacy with data.<br>

Driverless or autonomous vehicles will have a large number of positive effects on the local and global communities. 
These effects potentially include making roads safer, reducing congestion, increasing environmental advantages 
and will even increase mobility for elderly and disabled people in these communities. This technology will also 
provide a great platform to test new and ever improving renewable energy systems. It will also provide large 
positive safety impacts such as the ability to give control over to the automated driving system once fatigued 
and will reduce the human error in crashes, an issue plaguing local and global communities and costing billions 
of dollars in repairs and renumeration alone. While there are a large number of positive effects one obvious 
negative effect will be the loss of driving services provided by humans such as bus drivers and taxi drivers. 
Another possible negative effect, as with all new technologies would be the teething problems associated with 
reaching that goal. While it would take quite a few years to research and develop autonomous systems and 
infrastructure it would require even more years still to perfect such systems. Faulty devices and programming 
are very much expected and would greatly hamper a smooth overall change from manual to autonomous driving.<br>

	<h3 style="font-size: 60px; color: orange">Robots</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;clear: both;">
<img src="Pics/Market-Sizes.jpg" width="600" height="700" style="float:left;clear: both; margin-top:10px;margin-right:20px;border:10px solid orange;">
Robots are defined as a man-made machine that has up until now, 
been primarily designed for repeating, automatic, monotonous and/or dangerous tasks. In the past their roles 
included moving large heavy equipment or parts around in the forms of mechanical arms. While this purpose is 
still an ideal role for a robot their evolution has dramatically accelerated in the past few decades with the 
help of more powerful processors and an ever-increasing reliance on automated work. Now their roles have been 
applied across a vast amount of industries, dramatically increasing safety, accuracy and efficiency, while 
reducing risks and overall costs. If a repetitive or dangerous task exists, regardless of the industry, chances 
are it will be cheaper, safer and more efficient to perform that task with a robot. They can paint, weld, drill, 
cut, carry, dispose, they can go into a plethora of dangerous situations such as bomb disposal, nuclear radiation 
zones, active volcanos, space, deep underwater, gaseous areas and warzones to name just a few. Robots generally 
have 3 basic types of parts, a controller, mechanical parts and sensors. The controller is most commonly 
associated with being the brain, procedurally analysing a written program written by humans. The controller is 
responsible for giving tasks to the mechanical parts and collecting results or gathered information through 
sensors. Thus, their limitation is the programmer's code that has been written for them. If they fail in their 
task it is, in most situations, the program itself that has failed.<br><br>

<img src="Pics/Recommendations-1.jpg" width="320" height="760" style="float:right;clear: both; margin-top:10px;margin-left:20px;border:10px solid orange;">
The efficiency and safety of robots compared to humans are so superior that their tasks are ever increasing and 
replacing the roles humans have in their daily life and especially at their workplace. So far, the increase in 
human jobs being replaced by robots have had, for better or for worse, a significant impact on people's lives. 
From a managerial perspective, robots are never late, never sick, never take breaks, can be programmed for 
multiple tasks, have greater accuracy and perfect for dangerous situations. However, they also don't have human 
traits or common sense, they don't have creativity, empathy, they also don't have a personal touch or communicate 
with customers. These traits are some of the reasons many people still have jobs that could very easily be replaced 
by robots. Smaller businesses for example, cannot afford to change their workforce as the initial cost of robots 
is tremendous compared to the initial training costs of staff. Also, if the emotion and relationship aspects of 
social interaction are required for the position, then a person will always be in demand for that position. There 
are, however, many new industries changing to an autonomous workforce such as agriculture, military, warehousing, 
and security. Robots will also have a new but dramatic impact on future industries from house cleaning and customer 
service to age care. These new roles will require the advancement of some robot sub-industries such as artificial 
intelligence.<br><br>

Overall the effects robots have on local communities and society as a whole is positive. From monotonous chemical 
reactions in labs for vaccines and disease control to 24/7 cow milking robots guided by laser sensors. The robotic 
possibilities are basically endless. As a group of IT students, we will all interact with some form of robots in 
the future. From programming the control systems, monitoring systems, diagnosing problems or failures to maintaining 
and repairing, our lives will be forever intertwined with the evolution of robotics.
