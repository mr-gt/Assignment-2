    	<h3 style="font-size: 60px; color: orange">Autonomous Vehicles<h3> 
<p style="font-size: 20px">The idea of an autonomous vehicle has been around since the integration of 
cars and microchips. The dream of sitting in a seat similar to business class flights, watching movies, 
reading books and socialising with fellow passengers has been forever out of reach. However, in the 
coming decades, these days may soon be within our grasp. Only now are we adapting reliable and exciting 
new technologies to turn this dream into a reality. Most vehicles being released now feature some form 
of automation, even if it is still only the basic cruise control system. Some vehicles are even being 
released with newly developed autonomous technologies such as controlling small increments and decrements 
in cruising speeds during dense traffic, also known as adaptive cruise control, cars that can reverse 
parallel park without the driver's assistance and even include other features such as radar detection of 
cars in other lanes and safe overtaking systems for blind spots. In the upcoming years these automatic 
processes we currently have will be improved upon and will change or modify the necessary requirement of 
even being in control of the steering wheel at all. As of right now we have already developed autonomous 
vehicles that are completely driverless but are merely used as tour guides or used to provide elderly 
and/or disabled with new mobility services in places such as retirement villages. According to ADVI - 
the Australian and New Zealand Driverless Vehicle Initiative - we have attained partial automation, which 
in their 5 level system of automation, places our accomplishments at level 2. While we are close to achieving 
level 3 automation in the next few years, which includes all aspects of autonomous driving, the driver is 
still required to be ready at all times to take control of the wheel depending on certain situations. We are 
still approximately a decade from full automation and by 2026-2030, the goal of full automation may well be 
achieved. Full automation is detailed as not needing a driver at all and wont even require a steering wheel 
or a driver's seat in the vehicle anymore.<br><br>

Over the next decade or two, this autonomous technology will be enhanced even further to incorporate various 
other new technologies, some of which are still being developed theoretically and ethically. They have the 
potential to include new opportunities for various industries such as the energy sector, healthcare, financial 
and government services to include just a small few. From automatically paying tolls and fuel bills or fully 
automatic charging electric vehicles, collecting big data to improve cities drivability and driverless 
infrastructure, increasing energy efficiency to improving the safety of and even replacing the emergency services 
we currently rely on today, all these individual sectors or industries will be shaped by the autonomous potential 
lying ahead of us. There are a number of serious questions of ethical and social importance still yet to be 
explained and answered such as the effects on governments and energy sectors who have until now resisted new 
potential technological innovations and the ethical and societal questions relating to privacy with data.<br><br>

Driverless or autonomous vehicles will have a large number of positive effects on the local and global communities. 
These effects potentially include making roads safer, reducing congestion, increasing environmental advantages 
and will even increase mobility for elderly and disabled people in these communities. This technology will also 
provide a great platform to test new and ever improving renewable energy systems. It will also provide large 
positive safety impacts such as the ability to give control over to the automated driving system once fatigued 
and will reduce the human error in crashes, an issue plaguing local and global communities and costing billions 
of dollars in repairs and renumeration alone. While there are a large number of positive effects one obvious 
negative effect will be the loss of driving services provided by humans such as bus drivers and taxi drivers. 
Another possible negative effect, as with all new technologies would be the teething problems associated with 
reaching that goal. While it would take quite a few years to research and develop autonomous systems and 
infrastructure it would require even more years still to perfect such systems. Faulty devices and programming 
are very much expected and would greatly hamper a smooth overall change from manual to autonomous driving.<br>
