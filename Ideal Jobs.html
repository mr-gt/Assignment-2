My ideal job would be something very similar to a developer role such as front-end/back-end developer. 
This position would require me to lead the frontend and backend development of applications on both android an iOS. The role would 
be to create and maintain multiple apps that work across both platforms. This would be ideal for me because I love to create projects 
across varying number of personal interests such as music and computing.<br><br>

The skills required to be a successful candidate for a role such as this is include years of experience in the mobile device development 
industry, experience with iOS and android development, experience in a number of programming languages such as React Native, Redux and 
experience with PHP programming. It would also require a sound understanding of the development cycle of mobile applications and require 
experience using a number of development tools such as Git, Babel, webpack, Gulp, NPM, Karma and/or Grant. While having experience with 
iOS 10/11 or higher as a necessity, the role would also require database experience in MySQL and NoSQL, experience with 3rd party 
application programming interfaces and a solid comprehension of web-based security.<br><br>

As of now, my skills are limited to some basic Java, C++, Visualbasic and Realbasic experience. I also have some ground knowledge on using 
Git and Github. I plan to increase my understanding of these programming languages and programming tools and learn many other necessary 
programming skills over the next 3 years while I complete my Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. To further increase my chances of 
achieving the required criteria for a role similar to this, I plan to take a number of courses to build on my knowledge that would take me 
further down the path of a mobile application developer.<br>

The Network Design Engineer - Major Banks, also commonly known as a Network Architect, is a position that 
interests me greatly. This is a role that is instrumental in designing networks with an emphasis on security and risks associated with 
the design, system configuration, implementation, and the stability of the system.<br><br>

This position appeals to me as it is quite a great challenge to project manage such a large development within a significant company. 
You would have to be extremely proficient in networking capabilities with an emphasis on security systems, firewall management and implementation. 
I currently have limited knowledge of networking and security within large corporations, therefore to gain these skills I would need to have 
completed my degree and worked in the field of networking and security for a minimum of 7 years. Further study would be required as there is a 
need for knowledge on project management and design, core switching, routing technologies and security. The need for knowledge on networks such 
as local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), intranets and extranets would be required and experience in these would be essential 
for success.<br><br>

 By participating in educational opportunities and maintaining your personal network of colleagues can assist this greatly along with being 
associated with professional organizations. I love the idea of having the need for substantial attention to detail, as everything must be perfectly 
implemented and maintained in order for the business to run smoothly, combined with the integrity of the infrastructure, enabling the users to gain 
maximum performance from the equipment being used is of the utmost importance, as would be the security of the system. The documentation and 
enforcement of system standards and protocols by monitoring performance and access is one of the fundamental basics required to ensure system 
integrity and security.

	To be honest, I'm not entirely sure if I want to work in big data or in security, but what mostly makes this appealing to me is the 
challenging aspect of it. So, in big data I believe it is helping the company achieve greater things, I want to help in doing that for a workplace 
I enjoy, it also includes coding and learning languages in which I believe I'm good at. For this specific job, I'd be needing to get more into 
Computer Science as well as Mathematics. I'd have to learn more cloud-based technologies in Azure, as well as programming experience in Python. 
I'd also need previous experience in big data and similar jobs.<br><br>

I currently do not have sufficient experience for this job, I have worked in building PC's and other general jobs. Nothing related to coding and 
computer science. My current plan I have is to continue in my studies and get into a Bachelor of Information Technology & Data Analytics which I'm 
sure will provide me with the structure I need and skills I need for jobs like the one I listed above. I also plan to learn and play around with Python 
as well as other languages in my own time to see how well I can catch on.

My desired role at this point would be something similar to an IoT full stack developer. This developer role incorporates both front-end and back-end 
software development and is focused towards the Internet of Things concept. The skillset required for my desire role of an IoT full stack developer 
role includes .net, NoSQL, AWS, NodeJS, TypeScript and Node.js experience. The advertised job would also require software engineering skills, 
documentation skills, project management experience, communications skills, problem solving and teamwork experience.<br><br>

While I currently do not have any of these qualifications just yet I plan to complete this Bachelor of Information Technology course at RMIT, which 
would go a long way to achieving these qualifications. If other qualifications or experience is required of me after the end of the degree, I will 
then pursue through them work experience and further study in certificates and/or diplomas.
