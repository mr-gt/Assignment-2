It is safe to say that Extraversion and Introversion are probably the oldest notions in the history of 
personality theories. It has long been observed that some people are expressive, outgoing and comfortable in 
interacting with their surroundings - while others are reserved, quiet and more comfortable alone. It is as if 
the former sincerely enjoy engaging with the external world and recharge by communicating with other people, and 
the latter prefer to rely on themselves and their own inner world instead of seeking stimulation from the outside. 
We focus on these differences in our first scale, which we call Mind - it determines how we see and approach the 
outside world, including people, objects and activities within it. While Introversion and Extraversion are often 
used in lieu of social aptitude, this scale involves more than just being outgoing and social - although social 
skills form part of it. In a broader way, the Mind scale determines the degree of interaction with the outer world; 
how socially one behaves is just a part of that. In a sense, this scale is a contrast of the quantity and 
intensity of an experience and its quality or depth. The second scale in our model is called Energy and it 
connects Intuitive and Observant styles. In our opinion, this dichotomy is the most important - while the other 
four scales determine how you interact with the world (Mind), make decisions (Nature), schedule your activities 
(Tactics), or react to external feedback (Identity), the chasm between Intuitive and Observant individuals is far 
more significant as it actually determines how you see the world and what kind of information you focus on. 
It may seem like your decisions are the most important, but a decision is only as good as the understanding that 
backs it up.</p>

It may seem like your decisions are the most important, but a decision is only as good as the understanding that 
backs it up.With this in mind, all personality types can be divided into groups of those who favour the Intuitive (N) energy 
style (visionary, more interested in ideas, focusing on novelty) and those of the Observant (S) energy style 
(more interested in facts and observable things, focusing on the tried and tested).

<p style="font-size: 20px">The Nature scale determines how we make decisions and cope with emotions. While we all have feelings, there are 
significant differences in how we react to them and what role those feelings play in our lives. This then 
influences a number of other areas, mostly related to our interactions with other people. People with the 
Thinking (T) trait seek logic and rational arguments, relying on their head rather than their heart. They do 
their best to safeguard their emotions, shielding them from the outside world and making sure that they are not 
clearly visible. "Whatever happens, you must always keep a cool head" - this is the motto of Thinking types. 
However, this does not mean that these types are cold-blooded and indifferent. People with the Thinking trait 
are often just as emotional as those with the Feeling trait - but they tend to subdue and override their feelings 
with their rational logic.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px">The Tactics scale determines how we approach planning and available options. However, this affects more than 
just our calendars - at its core, this scale determines our attitude toward certainty and structure in our lives, 
both at mental and physical levels. People with the Judging (J) trait do not like to keep their options open - they would rather come up with five 
different contingency plans than just go ahead and deal with the challenges as they come. They prefer clarity 
and closure, always going with the plan rather than the flow. It is as if Judging types always keep a mental 
checklist, and when something is crossed off that list, it is done and not open to reassessment. This goes as 
much for groceries ("What will that go with?") as it does for life goals, like buying a house.
Furthermore, Judging individuals tend to have a very strong work ethic, putting their duties and responsibilities 
above everything else. Our research also indicates that Judging types are much stricter when it comes to law and 
order. Of course, this does not mean that the other group are lawbreakers, but if you see someone walk for five 
minutes so that they could get to the other side of the street using a crosswalk, they are much more likely to 
be a Judging type.In contrast, Prospecting (P) individuals are much more flexible and relaxed when it comes to dealing with both 
expected and unexpected challenges. They are always scanning for opportunities and options, willing to jump at 
them at a moments notice. People with this trait are perfectly aware that life is full of possibilities, and 
they are reluctant to commit to something that might well prove to be an inferior option in the future.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; max-width:1200px">The last scale, Identity, affects all 
others, showing how confident we are in our abilities and decisions. In a 
way, it acts as an internal sensor, reacting to the input we get from the environment - for instance, success or 
failure, feedback from other people, pressure caused by unexpected events and so on. Mind and Identity scales 
are the alpha and the omega of our model, acting like an external shell that we wear in all our interactions 
with the outside world - we discuss all four possible combinations of these traits in the "Strategies" section 
of our main theoretical article, but in this one, let's take a look at what the Identity scale looks like.
Assertive (-A) individuals are self-assured, even-tempered and resistant to stress. They refuse to worry too 
much and do not push themselves too hard when it comes to achieving goals. Similarly, they are unlikely to spend 
much time thinking about their past actions or choices - according to Assertive types, what's done is done and 
there is little point in analysing it. Not surprisingly, people with this trait report more satisfaction with 
their lives and they also feel more confident in their abilities to handle challenging and unexpected situations. 
In contrast, individuals with Turbulent (-T) identity are self-conscious and sensitive to stress. They experience 
a wide range of emotions and tend to be success-driven, perfectionistic and eager to improve. They are also more 
willing to change jobs if they feel stuck in their current one and to spend time thinking about the direction in 
which their life is going.However, while the Assertive variant may seem more positive on the surface, that is not 
always the case - for instance, Turbulent individuals perform better in certain roles as they push themselves to 
achieve superior results, while Assertive ones do not care about the outcome that much. Always feeling the need 
to do more, to have more, and to be more, Turbulent types often forget how exhausting that can be to both 
themselves and the people around them - but it is entirely possible that this desire to always push themselves 
just a little further helps many Turbulent types to achieve what they seek to achieve.</p>
