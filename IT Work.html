<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"><b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> What development tools have you used?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">I have never used development tools as I have a team that I use for software developement if and when required.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"> <b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> What programming languages have you used?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">I can read most programming languages, although I mainly use applications for diagnosing system problems and intergration, such as Apache Camel 
and Justransform which is a single Data Integration Cloud platform that connects and integrates any data source irrespective of technology or 
process requirements.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"> <b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> What are your technical qualifications?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Tracey told us that she did not have any formal qualifications! She has an accounting background and had been asked to diagnose a database problem 
within a "WMS" Warehouse Management System.  On completion of the project she was then offered more work of the same IT nature, whereby she would 
analyse systems that were not performing as they should and problem solve the issue until any bugs were removed or remedied. She said she was very 
proficient in the use of “ERP” Enterprise Resource Planning, which is software that helps software that helps to plan, budget, predict, and report 
on an organization’s financial results. Tracey mentioned that her IT knowledge had grown extensively over a 20 year period. Her main focus is on 
warehouse management systems from design, installation and integration, she also told us she had a thorough knowledge of cloud based computing.  
She has gained most of her knowledge by basically being thrown in the deep end and had to work things out for herself. She has completed some online 
learning but most of her skills have been obtained through on the job experience. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"> <b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> What do you do to maintain your technical qualifications?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">I use online learning material, lots of reading and practical work (in the deep-end stuff).</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"> <b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> How did your education help prepare you for this job?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Other than school, I have a background in Accounting which has given me an easy transistion to system analysis, as I have extensive experience with 
databases.  I mainly learn as I go as I said before, the deep end is where you learn because it is mainly sink or swim and in this industry if you cant 
swim you will drown! I have a skill whereby I can jump roles very easily as I pick things up quite quickly.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"> <b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> How would you rate your key competencies for this job?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Excellent communication skills (between countries) along with great problem solving skills. A thorough understanding of ERP's and intergration of 
third party applications. My only downfall is I dont have a complete understanding of programming.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"> <b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> What are your IT strengths and weaknesses?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">
STRENGTHS: Communication skills / Intergration of new systems / Function design / Extremely analytical / Problem solving.<br>
WEAKNESSES: Not being able to write code.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"> <b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> Tell me about the most recent project you worked on. What were your responsibilities?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">I implemented a new cloud based WMS - Warehouse Management system.

My key responsibilities were:<br><br>
• System design working parallel with the development team.<br>
• Configuration of the system.<br>
• Integration of third party applications and ensuring they were all operational without fail.<br>
• Dealing with any enhancement requests.<br>
• Ensuring it was functional being the most important.</p>	

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"> <b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> What technical websites do you follow?</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.oracle.com/au/index.html" style="font-size: 20px;">Oracle Australia | Integrated Cloud Applications and Platform Services</a></p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"> <b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> What elements are necessary for a successful team and why?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Strong Leadership / Good communication / Collaboration / Individuals with experience that compliments each other.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"> <b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> Tell me about the project you are most proud of, and what your contribution was?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">I completed a full system rebuild including implementing cloud solutions.  The ERP & WRS were both built from scratch based on my directions and once 
the project was live and running there were absolutly no errors</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"><b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> Describe your production deployment process.</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Schedule a window with the business and all parties involved.<br>
Deployment of modules and configuration.<br>
System integration test.<br>
Third party integration.<br>
Finally, user acceptance, testing and training.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"><b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> What did you do to ensure quality in your deliverables?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Everything is continually tested up to three rounds prior to production.  From Quality assurance testing, Unit testing and System integration test. 
Ensure hyper-care is in place for go-live. Complete a “smoke test” to ensure everything is running properly with regards to the operation.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"><b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> What percentage of your time do you spend unit testing?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Depends on the deployment, and module being tested.  I spend most of my time on system integration testing.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"><b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> What do you expect in the solution documents you are provided?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Function flow documents.<br>
Very detailed configuration settings.<br>
Architectural flow Documents.<br>
What platform the software is built on.<br>
List of integration tools required.<br>
Whether the coding was completed onshore or offshore.<br>
Grooming of the Quality Assurance team, both offshore and onshore, to ensure the code is of an excellent quality.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"><b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> What automated-build tools or processes have you used?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">I've just started using BitBucket in our testing environment. <i>"Bitbucket is a web-based version control repository hosting service owned by Atlassian, 
for source code and development projects that use either Mercurial or Git revision control systems. Bitbucket offers both commercial plans and free 
accounts" - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitbucket" style="color: orange;">Bitbucket</a></i></p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"> <b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> Would you be willing to take training or classes to improve your technical skills?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Yes without question, but only when I can get the time!</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"> <b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> What have you learned from mistakes on a technical job?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">I don’t make them! The answer to this is to test everything multiple times from modules to configuration.  One major point is to ensure that everyone 
is installing the same version of the software.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"> <b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> What tools are most helpful to you when trouble shooting and solving a problem?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Being able to use SQL and having access to the backend data for analysis.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;"> <b><i class="fa fa-fw fa-genderless"></i> Where do you see your IT career going in the next five years?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">I can see myself working further abroad from New Zealand to the UK. I would like to have greater involvement in the Oracle Communications 
Customer Advisory Board (CAB).</p>
